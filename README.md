- Daily vs Monthly vs Annual revenue and behavior segmentation

## 💡 Strategic Insights

## 🛠️ Tools Used

## 🧠 Customer Personas

Based on RFM scoring and contract regularity, we identified multiple behavioral segments, including:

- **High-Frequency, High-Monetary Customers** ("Top Users"): Require long-term fleet stability and loyalty incentives.
- **Medium-Frequency, Medium-Regularity** ("Butterflies"): Opportunity for bundling and conversion to annual contracts.
- **Low-Frequency, High-Monetary** ("Strategic Buyers"): Upsell potential via specialized offers.
